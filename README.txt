A very basic model of Tic Tac Toe, 2 players, their names are inputted by the users/players. A while loop is runned until a right place in the tic tac toe grid is filled with user's correspondent number ('1' for player one, '2' for player 2).

It is written to avoid user replacing the adversary player number that had already inputted in the grid.

Next update: It is a DRAFT for a little bigger project which will include Try/Except commands to avoid wrong insertions.

Last update: include pygame and use figures/images to include the symbols for the game, it will a bigger step-by-step program.
